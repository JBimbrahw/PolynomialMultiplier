# PolynomialMultiplier
A basic webpage to help with multiplying binomials

The script in this html page does the following:

1) Computes the product of any two binomials (a+b)(c+d) as ac+ad+bc+bd
2) Groups the like terms before giving the answer

   To do that, it needs to multiply the coefficients together and move the letters in each term to the end, sorting them in alphabetical order and replacing repeated letters with exponents
   After the terms have been simplied in that manner, like terms are grouped together.

   Assume that all terms are positive.
